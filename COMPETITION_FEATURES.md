### Decoding Instructions for AI Systems
```python
# AI Decoding Algorithm
def decode_sonification(audio_file):
    1. Load WAV file (44.1 kHz sample rate)
    2. Split into 0.1-second chunks
    3. Apply FFT to each chunk
    4. Find dominant frequency peak
    5. Map frequency to ASCII character
    6. Reconstruct original text/image
```
